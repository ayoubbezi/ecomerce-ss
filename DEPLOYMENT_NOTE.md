# Netlify Deployment - CSS Fix Notes

The BioGold e-commerce site includes several fixes for CSS paths when deployed to Netlify:

## Added Files

1. **path-fix.js** - Fixes relative paths in CSS links and images
2. **asset-loader.js** - Provides dynamic loading of CSS files with correct paths
3. **updateApiUrl.js** - Handles API URL updates for the backend connection

## Changes to Components.js

- Added `getAssetsBaseUrl()` function to get the correct base URL for assets
- Updated `loadHeader()` and `loadFooter()` to use the base URL for images

## Changes to HTML Files

- Added the path fixing scripts to the head section of all HTML files

## Netlify Configuration

- Updated `netlify.toml` with proper Content-Security-Policy settings
- Fixed domain name typo (changed `netify.app` to `netlify.app`)
- Added redirect rules for client-side routing

## How to Test Before Deploying

1. Open your site in a browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Check the Console for any path-related errors
4. Verify CSS is loading correctly

## Troubleshooting After Deployment

If you still have CSS issues after deploying to Netlify:

1. Check the Netlify deployment logs for any errors
2. Open the deployed site and check browser console for 404 errors on CSS files
3. Verify the path-fix.js script is executing (you should see path fixing logs in console)
4. Try clearing your browser cache and refreshing

Remember: The backend connection to Render is a separate issue from CSS loading. The CSS may still display correctly even if the backend connection isn't working properly.
